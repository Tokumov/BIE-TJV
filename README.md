# Specification
A Kazakh cuisine restaurant offers a unique dining experience that showcases the delicious and flavorful food of the Kazakh people. Kazakh cuisine is a fusion of various cooking traditions from Central Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, resulting in a rich and diverse menu. This project is about food delivery from a restaurant. The user will have to be able to order food and book the seats in the restaurant, and all his orders will have to be stored in the database.
# Complex query
- Choose all orders that have dishes that cost more than 3 euro, but total cost of order is under 15 euro.
